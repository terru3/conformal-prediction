# Conformal Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline with conformal prediction, i.e. prediction sets/intervals with finite-sample guarantees, rather than point predictions. For more information on conformal prediction / the inspiration behind this project, see "Practical Guide to Applied Conformal Prediction in Python" by Valery Manokhin.

For more, please see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
